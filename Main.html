                             I'll be working. When it comes to team development, I'm also 
                             an engaged participant and good listener, which will be a huge

                            artistic and creativity division, I am able to build my 
                            own image as both an artist and a computer engineer despite
                             it being two— totally— different fields. I code for artistry
